# LIRI Node App
#### LIRI - Is similar to Siri but for text based queries/responses.

This application uses *IMDB*, *Spotify*, and *Bands In Town* **APIs** to return information to the user.

**LIRI** works in the following way: 
1. First the use must install the proper libraries using:
>npm install

2. Start **LIRI** by typing:
>node liri.js

3. You can give **LIRI** the following commands: 
<br>
 `concert-this`, `spotify-this-song`, `movie-this`, `do-what-it-says`
 4. For each command (except `do-what-it-says`) enter a search term after the command to get a result.

*If no search term is typed, then a default query will incur.*
